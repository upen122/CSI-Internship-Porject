# 🌍 Azure Data Factory – Country Data Pipeline

## 📌 Task 1 – Fetch & Store Country Data Using REST API

This pipeline fetches data from `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{country}` for the following countries:

- 🇮🇳 India  
- 🇺🇸 United States  
- 🇬🇧 United Kingdom  
- 🇨🇳 China  
- 🇷🇺 Russia

The pipeline saves the result as individual `.json` files in Azure Data Lake Storage.

---

## 🏗️ Pipeline Logic

- A **ForEach loop** iterates over the list of countries stored in a variable.
- It dynamically calls the **REST API** using a parameterized dataset.
- It uses a **Copy activity** to write each response to Azure Data Lake Storage in **JSON format**.

## 🧠 Notes

- The REST API supports multiple parameters but this implementation uses one country at a time to avoid throttling.
- Error handling and retry policy can be enhanced with ADF built-in features.
